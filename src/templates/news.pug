                    p.has-drop-cap building a computer that could match the power of the human brain has long been a goal of scientists. BM (International Business Machines Corporation) has been around for somewhat over one hundred years ago and since then IBM has established itself as one of the best computer brands worldwide serving one hundred and seventy different countries. There is a huge disparity between the human brain’s cognitive capability and ultra-low power consumption when compared to today’s computers. These brain-inspired chips could transform mobility, via sensory and intelligent applications that can fit in the palm of your hand but without the need for Wi-Fi. This achievement underscores our leadership role at pivotal transformational moments in the history of computing via long-term investment in organic innovation.
                    p When someone says their computer is low on memory… what exactly do they mean? Are they running out of space to save files, or is the computer running slow?
                    p System RAM (Random Access Memory) – this is generally in the range of 256 megabytes to 8 gigabytes on recent systems.  This is where programs reside and run from while the computer is running.  When you shut it down, it gets cleared – temporary usage, so to speak.
